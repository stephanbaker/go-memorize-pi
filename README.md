# Go Memorize Pi
This was the result of having a little fun on Pi Day 2016.  It's a simple command line game that helps the user memorize the number Pi.  The application starts you at the number three, then invites you to guess the next digit in the sequence.  If you can recite the first 50 decimal places of Pi, you win.  Enjoy!
